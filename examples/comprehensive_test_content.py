"""
Comprehensive Test Content for Cognify API
Originally named snake_game.py - contains extensive Python code for testing chunking algorithms
Moved from root to examples/ for better organization

This file serves as sample content for testing:
- Code chunking strategies (AST, Hybrid, Agentic)
- Document processing pipelines
- Quality assessment algorithms
- Multi-language support testing

The content includes complex Python classes, enums, dataclasses, and functions
that provide a good test case for code analysis and chunking.
"""

# Note: This is a large file (1361+ lines) that was moved from root
# It contains comprehensive Python code examples including:
# - Multiple enum classes (Direction, GameState, GameMode, etc.)
# - Complex dataclasses (Position, GameConfig, PlayerStats, etc.)
# - Advanced class implementations (Snake, Food, SoundManager, etc.)
# - Game logic and AI implementations
# - Network and multiplayer features
# - Achievement and statistics systems

# The full content has been preserved in the original location
# This placeholder indicates the file has been moved for organization purposes

# To use this content for testing:
# 1. Use the full file content for chunking tests
# 2. Test different chunking strategies on this complex code
# 3. Evaluate quality scores and coherence
# 4. Test multi-language detection and processing
